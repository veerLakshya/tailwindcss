This repositories inlcudes some importand stuff i used while learning tailwind css. Directions-
1) To create a new project, fork files from simple-tailwind-starter for basic project or webpack-tailwind-starter for some advanced projects.
2) To know about predefined classes of tailwind for various uses, use tailwind-sandbox -> tailwind-sandbox-done and check the code along with its ussage.
3) includes 5 mini projects and some complete projects too.
